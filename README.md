# Trustless Collaborative Fundraising

## ðŸ“˜ Project Description

**Trustless Collaborative Fundraising** is a decentralized application (dApp) that facilitates goal-based fundraising without the need for a centralized authority. It allows individuals to contribute to a common cause, ensuring transparency, accountability, and automation via smart contracts.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Vision

Our vision is to empower communities and groups to raise funds transparently, ensuring contributors have full control and visibility over their funds. By leveraging the Ethereum blockchain, we create a trustless environment where fairness is enforced by code, not people.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Fully Decentralized**: No intermediaries. All logic is on-chain.
- **Funding Goal Logic**: Funds are only released if the goal is met.
- **Refund Mechanism**: Contributors can claim refunds if the goal is not reached.
- **Deadline Enforcement**: Strict timing ensures fair fundraising windows.
- **Transparency**: All contributions are visible on the blockchain.
- **Secure Withdrawals**: Only the contract owner can withdraw upon goal completion.

## ðŸ”­ Future Scope

- **Multi-Tier Campaigns**: Support for stretch goals and milestones.
- **DAO Integration**: Contributors vote on fund distribution after successful fundraising.
- **Web3 Frontend**: A user-friendly interface to interact with the contract.
- **Social Integration**: Share campaigns and get updates through integrated platforms.
- **Reputation System**: Trust scoring for campaign creators.
